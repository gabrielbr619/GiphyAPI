# GiphyAPI

The purpose of this is learn how to use "public" APIs, for a number of reasons, but mostly my personal projects

<h2>About the project</h2>

The project itself, it's simple, a page that onload shows a random gif from GIPHY, or when the button is pressed.
I didn't expect the hardest part to be the <em>"promises"</em>, but it was, and it was hard for sure, yet after reading and re-reading the documentation, watching and re-watching many videos on the topic, I finally did it.
